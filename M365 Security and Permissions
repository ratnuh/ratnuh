In this topic I'd like to cover cloud concepts and how Microsoft 365 allows you to implement 
structured security regulations built into the Microsoft 365 system.
This will also cover pricing and support, and the overiew of public, private, and hybrid clouds; 
and their on-premise and cloud based data solutions.

The cloud is a relatively new concept, popularized in the 2000s. Everyone knows what a cloud means "data stored eslwhere"
but when you drill down and what it is, its not common knowledge.
  1. Networking, acessing files on a server
  2. Using the internet to connect to said server
  3. Services 

Services
-Data, store in the server or database
-Networking, again data stored on a database but within a LAN or WAN
-Applications, accessed virtually, using said data
-VMs (Virtual Machines), fully operational computers running an OS apart from your own
-Analytics, allows you to analyze information store about the information being used on your server

Cloud types
-Public, space purchased on servers to share information within a company
-Private, a dedicated server for a single organization to use with no pre set apps
-Hybrid, combination of the first two, holding some services on cloud and some on dedicated


Windows 10 Enterprise Tools
  -Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection: A simple virus protection service that works to pre-emptively
negate and defend users from viruses, BEFORE they affect a operating system. This is automated, cloud enabled,
and always updates automatically. This includes Application control for addmins, application guard to avoid malware,
and credentials guard to allow admins to control user access.
  -Windows update tool: Desktop analytics for device health, offers 30 month support for september releases.
Additionally offers a Long term systm channel, that ensure no changes in functionality over time.
  -Windows 10 etnerprise Management: INcludes virtual desktop, accessed on azure servers allowing users to access
their desktops at any time. User experience manager allows admins to change users application access and feature access.
Finally, cloud activation allows user to upgrade to new versions of windows.
  -UE-V or User Enviroment Virtualization allows windows to store user preferences and create a smoother experience'
when using different desktops and the same user settings.
  -Application virtualization (App-v) allows admins to provide virtualized win32 apps to users to allow backward compatibility.

Now we have a basic understanding of the topics discussed, we'll start to understand the applications offerede
within Microsoft 365 and how to impliment their measures into our cloud system.

Scenario:
Your team is working on a project, and you want specific people to have access to the project documents in a SharePoint library. 
You need to:
Add permissions for new team members to view and edit the documents.
Remove permissions from team members who are no longer part of the project.

Adding Permissions for New Users

Go to the Document Library:
Sign into the Microsoft 365 admin portal and navigate to SharePoint.
Find and open the specific document library where you want to manage permissions.
Open Library Settings:
In the document library, click on the “Settings” gear icon in the top-right corner.
Select “Library settings.”
Manage Access:
In the library settings, go to “Permissions for this document library.”
Click on “Grant Access” or “Invite people,” and enter the email addresses of the users you want to add.
Set Permission Level:
Assign the desired permissions: “Read” (view only) or “Edit” (view and edit).
Click “Share” or “Send,” depending on your SharePoint version.

Removing Permissions for existing users:
Go to Permissions:
Return to the document library settings, as before.
Select “Permissions for this document library.”
Find the User to Remove:
In the permissions list, locate the user whose access you want to revoke.
Select the checkbox next to their name.
Remove Permissions:
Click on “Remove User Permissions.”
Confirm the action, and the user will no longer have access to the document library.

Alternatively, it is possible to do this via powershell:
Open PowerShell and connect to SharePoint Online:
Connect-SPOService -Url https://yourdomain-admin.sharepoint.com

Grant Access to multiple users (replace placeholders with actual data):
Set-SPOUser -Site https://yourdomain.sharepoint.com/sites/YourSiteName -LoginName user@example.com -IsSiteCollectionAdmin $true

Revoke Access for multiple users:
Remove-SPOUser -Site https://yourdomain.sharepoint.com/sites/YourSiteName -LoginName user@example.com

To be more brief permissions can be managed in a multitude of ways, including Autopilot; which was developed for
more IT admins to control devices on a network.
Set Up Autopilot:
Ensure you have a Microsoft 365 or Windows 10/11 Business or Enterprise subscription.
Register your devices with Autopilot. You can do this via the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center or by importing device information from a CSV file.
Configure Profiles:
Create and configure deployment profiles in the Microsoft Endpoint Manager. These profiles define the user experience, device settings, and enrollment methods.
Assign Profiles:
Assign the created profiles to the registered devices. This tells Autopilot which settings to apply during the setup process.
Prepare Devices:
Ensure the devices are reset to factory settings before deployment. This allows them to recognize and apply the Autopilot settings.
User Experience:
When a user powers on the device, it connects to the internet, checks in with Autopilot, and applies the assigned profile automatically. The user then signs in with their work or school account.
Manage Devices:
After deployment, use the Microsoft Endpoint Manager to manage and monitor the devices, apply policies, and push updates as needed.

Microsoft Sharepoint is a way to manage all the resources that are available to your users, Sharepoint allows you to group documents, websites, and integrates these 
into other microsoft services in real time. This is also shared between multiple administrators and can be edited collaborated on.
Create a Team Site:

Go to SharePoint and select “Create site.”
Choose “Team site” to set up a collaborative space for your project.
Set Up the Homepage:
Customize the homepage by adding a title and a brief description of the project.
Use web parts to display important information:
Text web part for project goals and updates.
Document library web part for easy access to project files.
Calendar web part to highlight important deadlines and meetings.
Add Team Members:
Go to “Site permissions” and invite team members to join the site.
Assign appropriate roles (e.g., owner, member) based on their responsibilities.
Create Lists for Task Management:
Use the “List” feature to create a task list where team members can track progress.
Include columns for task description, assigned to, due date, and status.
Integrate Microsoft 365 Tools:
Add links to Microsoft Teams for chat and meetings.
Integrate Planner for detailed task management.
Set Up Version Control:
Enable version history in the document library to keep track of changes made to project documents.
Customize Navigation:
Adjust the site navigation for easy access to key sections, like “Documents,” “Tasks,” and “Calendar.”

And finally, this can all be accessed with a plan and the pricing guide will be as follows:
Here’s an overview of Microsoft 365 pricing, including approximate costs (note that prices may vary based on region and promotions):
 Individual Plans:
- **Microsoft 365 Personal:** ~$69.99/year or ~$6.99/month
- **Microsoft 365 Family:** ~$99.99/year or ~$9.99/month (up to 6 users)

 Business Plans:
- **Microsoft 365 Business Basic:** ~$6.00/user/month (annual commitment)
- **Microsoft 365 Business Standard:** ~$12.50/user/month (annual commitment)
- **Microsoft 365 Business Premium:** ~$22.00/user/month (annual commitment)

 Enterprise Plans:
- **Microsoft 365 E3:** ~$36.00/user/month (annual commitment)
- **Microsoft 365 E5:** ~$57.00/user/month (annual commitment)

I hope this has been a good example of the basic understanding of how to use Microsoft 365 to change user access and overall security;
with lmited practical use, in my little time using M365 and testing security measures via powershell, I have picked up a wide range 
of Microsoft 365 services.
