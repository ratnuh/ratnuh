In this write-up I will be covering things I have learned in my studies and during me getting my certification for AWS.
While this is mostly notes, I will also show some practical examples of things like cloud architecture and IAM security measures.

What is cloud computing?
  - Cloud computing is a on demand service delivering IT services; eliminating the need to own, store, and maintain physical systems such as databases and servers
      This is offered on a as-needed basis directly from AWS or other similar cloud providers.
  - AWS is the worlds leading and most comprehensive cloud adopted across the world. Offering 200 services in data centers globally. 

Advantages to Cloud Computing__
 - Variable expense, pay for what you use and not what you predict you need.
 - Benefits from economy of scale, economy of scale refers to the lower variable cost for users, based on how many people are hosted in the cloud through AWS.
 - As said before, theres no need to predcit usage and cost. Using things such as the price calculator helps determine cost before service is obtained.
 - Because of services being held in the cloud, they become isntanly accessible.
 - Because of the cloud storing your systems, they become available in any region; in minutes.

Cloud Networks are hosted in three different forms: Cloud, On-Premise (Private Cloud), or Hybrid (a mix of the two)
Cloud networks like AWS offer a global infrastructure, these are split into regions. Within each region, availability zones; these allow for you to have
redundancy in your systems and help negate faults. They also scale easily and can copy and spread into the other zones and regions.

Security and Compliance___
  - In cloud security, there is a shared responsibility model. Certain responsibilities are held by Amazon and some are held by the user/administrator.
  - Users control the services they choose to impliment, giving permissions and abilities to users accessing their service.
  - Amazon controls the cloud, protection from DDOS attacks and certain backend attacks youd expect on databases and servers.
  - AWS offers you guides and expertise to help you navigate issues. They offer hundreds of tools to help you meet security objectives.
 Compliance
  - AWS is beholden to certain laws and regulations implimented by the government, for example:
 • SOC 1/ISAE 3402, SOC 2, SOC 3
 • FISMA, DIACAP, and FedRAMP
 • PCI DSS Level 1
 • ISO 9001, ISO 27001, ISO 27017, ISO 27018
