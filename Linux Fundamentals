This page will cover my knowledge surrounding Linux as a beginner and things I have learned from TryHackMe
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Given I had no experience within the OS, it was nice to see some silly commands such as:
Echo- repeats text given following the command
whoami- tells you your user (actually useful in pentesting)

Commands I commonly use, help navigate what can seem a daunting endless list of code.

| Command    |                                               |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------|
|    ls      | List files available in current directory     |
|    cd      | followed by directory will change your pwd    |
|    cat     | Reads file within the command box             |
|    pwd     | Tells you your "present working directory"    |
|    find    | Finds specific in your directory (find psd.md)|
|    wc      | Counts the number of files matching(wc psd.md)|
|    grep    | Searches file for given name (grep 123 psd.md)|
|    su      | Elevates all future commands as root          |

Shell Operators 
| Command    |                                               |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------|
|    &       | Runs operation as a background process        |
|    &&      | Makes a list of commands run                  |
|    >       | Directs your output (grep > output.txt)       |
|    >>      | Overwrites content of file (If already exist) |

The following section will follow common commands used in conjunction with others.

| Command argument|                                          |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|-------------|
|    -a   | Used to signify all (ls -a : List all)                         |
| --help  | Used in almost any context (-h too) to list available commands |
|   -R    | Remove file used in context (file.txt -R)                      |

Next ill go over the final bits of what I was taught and some general utilities that are helpful in almost every scenario.

Text Editors: there is a few different text editors, one being nano; my personal favorite. The other being VIM.
Nano: accessed by typing (nano) and can also be followed by a the title of what you want to title the document.
Nano also has its own set of commands
