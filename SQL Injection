Breifly; SQL (Structured Query Language) Injection; is a type of malciious command execution caused by maalicious queries on a website.
This is common when communication goes unfettered between a server and a unverified user. While attacking web applications in such way is old, it is also the most damaging.

_Database_
  A electronic storage unit, controlled by a  Database Management System (DBMS). There are two types of databases; relational and non-relational. 
I've focused on relational databases for my future examples; common ones you'll come across are MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Access, PostgreSQL and SQLite.
Databases store info for a multitude of operations, for an example; a store. This stores customer information is stored in things called tables, which is read by said database.
